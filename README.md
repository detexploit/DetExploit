## Abstract

DetExploit is software that detect vulnerable applications and not-installed important OS updates on the system, and notify them to user.

As we know, most of cyberattacks uses vulnerability that is released out year before.

I thought this is huge problem, and this kind of technology should be more powerful than technology that will detect unknown malwares or exploits.

Also this project is my theme of [Mitou Jr](https://jr.mitou.org/index_en.html) project in Japan.

I wish and work hard to make this an huge OSS (Open Source Software) project, to help these days society.
