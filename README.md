## Info (Last Update: 2019/10/04)

Hi, thank you for visiting this repository.  
You may know that there is no commit for a while...... but development is still going on !!!  
Currently, I am re-writing whole program into C++ to reduce binary size and more advantages.  
This is very important procedure to release our program, so please understand it... :)  
I've prepared some milestone, so you may check out it!!  

```
Schedule

1. Python to C++ to resuce binary size
2. Release binary from GitHub Releases
3. Publish demo movies of client/server (Currently working on ...)
4. Publish slides of DetExploit (Japanese version is already ready, so wait for little bit more!!)

## Abstract

DetExploit is software that detect vulnerable applications and not-installed important OS updates on the system, and notify them to user.

As we know, most of cyberattacks uses vulnerability that is released out year before.

I thought this is huge problem, and this kind of technology should be more powerful than technology that will detect unknown malwares or exploits.

Also this project is my theme of [Mitou Jr](https://jr.mitou.org/index_en.html) project in Japan.

I wish and work hard to make this an huge OSS (Open Source Software) project, to help these days society.
